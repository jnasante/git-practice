Patrick Richardson

Edmond, Oklahoma

1 - I enjoy camping and hiking and have done extensive solo traveling, which is kind of scary but also super rewarding

2 - I love music!! I’ve played in orchestras, jazz bands, rock bands, hip-hop bands, electronic music projects and more. Going to concerts and festivals is my favorite thing to do.

3 - I’m super excited about being your Team Leader this semester.  I’ve never taken on a challenge like this before but with the help of you, the biz team,  the alumni, Joseph, and the staff we are going to rock the Pinying launch so badly.
